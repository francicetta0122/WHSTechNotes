Computer science and technology greatly impact elections, from enhancing efficiency to raising security concerns.

Positive Impact: Technology improves accessibility and speed. For example, electronic voting machines and online registration streamline processes, helping increase voter participation and reduce counting errors.

Challenge or Concern: Security remains a key issue. Cyber threats, like hacking voting systems or spreading disinformation on social media, risk undermining election integrity. For instance, in 2020, social platforms had to counter misinformation with stricter controls. Ensuring secure systems through encryption and regular audits is crucial, but challenging on a large scale.
